/**
 * The structural-container half of the node SPI (docs/020 §4.2) — the symmetric
 * twin of the object `NodeView` (`node-view.ts`).
 *
 * A structural node owns block *children* the engine renders recursively (a
 * callout box, a list, the future table), so its contract is shaped around
 * wrapping rendered children rather than painting a baked snapshot. Before this
 * SPI, structural rendering was hardcoded `node.type === "callout"/"list"`
 * branches in `react-view.tsx` (live) and `resting-document.tsx` (resting); now
 * each structural type registers a `StructuralNodeView` and the dispatcher keeps
 * no node-type knowledge (docs/016 §10).
 *
 * Scope: this is the **view half**. Its core twin — `StructuralDefinition`
 * (`core/structural-registry.ts`) — owns a structural type's insert subtree and
 * compat round-trip, so a registered type now inserts (generic `insert-structural`
 * command) and survives save/load with no per-type core branch (note §7). Both
 * halves register through the same `registerNode({ structuralView,
 * structuralDefinition })` front. Scope membership is structural-by-kind
 * (`childrenOf` treats every `kind === "structural"` node as a scope — there is no
 * per-type `isScope`). `StructuralNodeType` (`model.ts`) is the registry-driven
 * open set (docs/021 §8.1), so a registered type need not be a built-in literal.
 * `quote`/`list`/`listitem` keep hardcoded compat branches until migrated.
