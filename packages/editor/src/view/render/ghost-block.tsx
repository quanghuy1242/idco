/**
 * `GhostBlock` — the inert render of a REMOVED block during inline review (docs/038 §4–§5, R6-J J0).
 *
 * Why this is a distinct branch, not `QuarantineBlock`
 * ---------------------------------------------------
 * During review the live document is the *proposed / current* side, so a **removed** block is not
 * in the store — the removal exists only on the diff's **base** side. `EngineBlock` resolves its
 * node from the store and returns `null` for an absent id (`block-dispatch.tsx:61`), so it can never
 * render a removal. The ReviewModel (docs/038 §5) instead resolves a removed id to its base-side
 * `EditorNode` and mounts it through this branch. It is deliberately NOT the
 * `QuarantineBlock` seam: that renders a store-*present* node whose schema group is disallowed; a
 * ghost is a store-*absent* node carried by the diff. (The first-draft docs/036 §6.2 claimed the
 * quarantine seam; it cannot host an absent node — corrected here and in docs/038.)
 *
 * The one load-bearing detail
 * ---------------------------
 * It emits `data-engine-block-id={node.id}` and registers through `registerBlock`, exactly as every
 * live block does (`block-dispatch.tsx`). That single attribute is what lets the whole existing
 * `[data-engine-block-id]` stack treat a ghost like any block for free:
 *   - `geometry.ts` resolves its viewport rect (`el.closest("[data-engine-block-id]")`);
 *   - the `ResizeObserver` in `use-virtual-window.ts` measures it and caches its height by id — and
 *     estimator calibration is skipped for it, because `store.getNode(ghostId)` is `null`
 *     (`use-virtual-window.ts` guards `if (node)`), so a ghost never poisons the live estimator;
 *   - the offset model virtualizes it in place at its `baseIndex` slot.
 *
 * Inert by construction (the "ghosts are widgets, not text" rule, docs/038 §3): `contentEditable`
 * is false, pointer + selection are off, and it is `aria-hidden`, so the caret skips it and no
 * per-block EditContext ever binds to it — which is what keeps splicing ghosts around the focused
 * block from tearing that block's EditContext host (the J0 no-tear proof).
 *
 * SCOPE: a removed leaf shows its base text struck through; a removed object/container shows a
 * labelled band (a removed container is ONE ghost — its subtree is not individually ghosted, so it
 * under-measures its old height, docs/038 §5.2). Removed-*child* recursion inside a surviving
 * container is done as of J2 — `block-dispatch` splices this branch into a container's merged child
 * assembly via `ReviewRenderContext`, so a removed row/item/cell renders in place — this component is
 * unchanged by that; it renders one node wherever the dispatch mounts it. Faithful reader-parity
 * ghost content (a removed image showing its figure, a removed code block its source) is the J3
 * refinement; J2's point is that a ghost renders, measures, and virtualizes at any depth in the flow.

// The ghost is MINIMAL and read-only (docs/039 R-RO, D9): struck base content, inert, and nothing
// else — no border, no wash, no uppercase "REMOVED" badge. The old `GHOST_BOX` was a mini diff-view
// card, exactly the card-in-prose docs/038 §1–§2 forbids in the woven surface. The removal's status now
// reads in the ONE shared language: the passive marker layer paints a RED gutter bar on this element
// (it carries `data-engine-block-id`, docs/039 R-GI), the same bar every other change wears. A hidden
// label keeps the status announced for assistive tech since the word is no longer painted (R-NL).

  // aggregate total. Padding is inside the border box, so the treap measures the full footprint.
