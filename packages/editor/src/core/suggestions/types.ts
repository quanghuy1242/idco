 *
 * A suggested edit is an **attributed op-log branch**, not markup baked into the document: a
 * `Proposal` carries the author, the revision it was made against, and the `Step[]` that express the
 * change in the model's own algebra. The proposed document is `applyProposal(current, proposal)` and
 * the woven diff is `diffSnapshots(current, proposed)` — so a proposal renders and resolves through
 * the diff engine that already ships, with no per-node "suggested" bit polluting the live model
 * (docs/036 D9/D12). The ops are identity-anchored (node ids, and character ids at text boundaries),
 * so applying a proposal to a document that moved since it was made is a merge by identity, not an
 * offset rebase (docs/036 D15) — see `apply-proposal.ts`.
 *
 * These are pure data shapes with no store, DOM, or React dependency, so a headless producer
 * (docs/037's agent) can mint a `Proposal` and a headless consumer can apply it.
