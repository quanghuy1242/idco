# Owned editor — parity gaps to close (grounded against legacy Lexical + the reader plan)

## What this is

A backlog of what the owned-model editor (`packages/editor`) still misses versus the legacy Lexical editor (`packages/editor-legacy`) and the read tier (docs/015), found by grounding the two side by side. Each item names the gap, where it is specified, the current state, and — for the SPI items — the concept it should be built on, so it can be picked up one at a time. This is a working list, not a design doc; it carries enough concept to start each slice without re-deriving it. Layout-shell parity (field label, bordered frame, error slot) and the side/aside TOC rail are deliberately out of scope; the aside rail was removed by design and the shell is the host's concern.

## 1. Alignment control (left / center / right / justify)

Missing as an editing control on both editors; only the reader renders it. The owned engine never exposes it (docs/023 §"Built-in Home layout" says Home is "006 §4.2 minus alignment which the owned engine does not expose as a control today"). Legacy also dropped element `format` in its serializer and renderer (docs/001 §111). The read tier already maps `format` to align, so the reader is ahead of the editor here (`packages/content-renderer/src/index.tsx` `elementAlign`, lines 459-463).

What it takes: an `align` block attribute on the model, a command to set it, and one `Align v` dropdown slot on Home showing the active value (target shape at docs/006 §4.2:284 and the node field sketch at docs/006 §5.5:661). Self-contained and small; no host binding involved. The reader already paints it, so this is editor-control-only.

**Status (2026-06-24): done.** Grounding corrected the storage decision: alignment is *not* a new `align` attr — the owned model already round-trips element alignment as `attrs.format` (the import picks `format` into attrs for paragraph/heading/quote, `flat-blocks.ts`; `exportTextNode` spreads attrs back out, `compat.ts`), the exact field the reader's `elementAlign` maps to align. So no compat change was needed. Shipped: a `currentAlign` helper + `current-align` query (`commands/shared.ts` / `commands/index.ts`) reading `attrs.format`; a `home.paragraph` toolbar slot + an `Align` popover command (`command-builtins.tsx`) whose four options write `attrs.format` through the existing generic `set-block-attr` (`left` clears it, the reader's default), ribbon-only per docs/006 §4.2. Tests: `tests/editor/engine-alignment.test.ts` (query + clear + compat round-trip + the registered control). Follow-up fix (same day): the first cut set the model but the *live editor never painted it* — `blockStyleFor` (`view/styles.ts`) ignored `attrs.format`, so the control looked like a no-op (global and scoped/cell/callout alike, since all text renders through it). Now `blockStyleFor` emits `text-align` for center/right/justify (left/absent keeps the shared fast-path), covered by a `blockStyleFor` test.

## 2. Host data provider SPI (the spine)

Specified at docs/006 §5 "Data Provider Contract", restated for the owned engine at docs/011 §12.1/§12.3. The owned engine built only the upload corner — `uploadImage(file) → {src}` (`owned-model-editor.tsx:51`). Media and post-ref are manual text fields today (`view/nodes/post-ref.tsx:14-20`); there is no picker, no host data resolution, no general provider registry, and `allowedEmbedDomains` gating is gone. Do not port the legacy `RichTextEditorBindings` verbatim — build it on the concept below and route it through the existing node SPI (`registerNode` / `configFields`, docs/016), not a parallel registry.

### 2.1 The concept: sort object nodes by where the source of truth lives

Every object node is exactly one of two kinds, and the data-provider SPI applies to one of them only.

- **Owned blocks** — the content *is* the truth. Code block, callout, table, divider, mermaid. The author types it, the node owns it, nothing external. Editing means editing the node's own data. These keep `configFields` as typed inputs plus the live-edit surface and are **out of scope** for this SPI.
- **Reference blocks** — the node is a *serialized projection of a record that lives in a host collection*. Media (an asset record), post-ref / chapter-ref / author-ref / citation (a collection record). The truth lives in the host; the node stores `{ ref, snapshot }` — a stable id plus a denormalized copy of the display fields. Media storing `alt/url/caption` and post-ref storing `title/url/postId` are the same shape of thing: a cached projection of an external record.

The test for which kind a block is: *does editing it mean picking a different external record, or typing content?* Picking → reference block → this SPI. Typing → owned block → stays on `configFields`/live-edit.

### 2.2 Reference block, defined precisely

`data = { ref, snapshot }`, bound to a host **source**. The node never owns the truth; it caches a projection. **Pick** sets the ref + snapshot; **resolve** refreshes the snapshot from the ref. **Upload** is a pick that *creates* the record first, then references it.

A source offers up to two capabilities, and today's kinds are just different capability combos — one concept, capabilities vary, so media/post/embed stop being three bespoke bindings:

- Media library: `load` (browse/search) + `resolve`; author picks from the collection, or uploads (create → pick).
- Post / chapter / author ref: `load` + `resolve`; author searches the collection.
- Embed (youtube): **no `load`**, `resolve` only (oEmbed); author pastes a URL as a free-text ref. This is why embed is not a third species — it is a reference block whose source can't browse.

### 2.3 The three-actor seam (this is what keeps it general, not random)

Three actors, decoupled by a source-id string — the same registry-by-string pattern already used for blocks, marks, and commands.

- **The source** (deployment-owned): returns whatever the host's records look like — domain-agnostic `ResourceOption`s. Knows nothing about blocks.
- **The block** (author-owned): owns the *projection* — `toData(option) → patch` adapts a generic option into *its* data shape, and `renderResting` paints the snapshot. Knows nothing about the host's backend.
- **The engine**: the picker, the `{ref, snapshot}` cache, resolve scheduling, gating, reader static render.

The payoff of that seam: **one source can feed many blocks.** A `products` source feeds a `product-card`, an inline `product-mention`, and a `comparison-row`, each with its own `toData` projection. That multiplexing is the concrete reason sources and blocks must be *separate* registries joined by id, not one fused thing — and it means a host adds a new referenceable collection by registering one source, and every block that projects it lights up.

### 2.4 What the SPI gates — and only this

The host registers **sources** (`{ id, load?, resolve? }`). A reference-block node declares "my data projects source X" through a resource config-field. That is the entire gated surface. Everything downstream is generic engine the host never touches: the picker UI (the standardized React Aria ComboBox + `ListBoxLoadMoreItem`, per the "standardize don't diverge" rule), the `{ref, snapshot}` caching, the resolve scheduling, and the reader rendering the stored snapshot statically with no host call (docs/015 — the snapshot is what makes the reference block reader-safe; legacy was resolve-on-render only).

### 2.5 This SPI *is* the custom-block-data SPI, not a parallel one

"Generalize the data provider" and "let a custom block reference host data" are the same work. The moment the resource config-field kind and `registerDataSource` are public, a custom block gets host-data reference for free, because a custom reference block is literally `registerNode` + a resource field bound to a source. So there is no separate "custom block data" phase to defer — it only appears as separate work if item 2 is built *wrong*, as media/post-only bindings. The forcing function: **rebuild the built-in `media` and `post-ref` on this SPI.** If the two built-ins still work after the refactor, the SPI is general by construction; they become proof instances, not special cases left beside it.

### 2.6 Worked example — a `product-card` custom reference block (end to end)

The shape a feature author writes, to make the SPI concrete (sketch, not final API):

```text
// Deployment wires the collection once, against its real backend:
registerDataSource({
  id: "products",
  load:    (q, signal) => api.searchProducts(q, signal),   // ResourceOption[]
  resolve: (id, signal) => api.getProduct(id, signal),     // ResourceOption | null
})

// Block author registers the node — knows the source id, not the backend:
registerNode({
  view: {
    type: "product-card",
    insert: { label: "Product", group: "Data", keywords: ["product", "shop"] },
    configFields: [
      { kind: "resource", key: "ref", source: "products", label: "Product",
        toData: (opt) => ({ ref: opt.id, title: opt.title, price: opt.price, img: opt.image }) },
    ],
    renderResting: ({ node }) => <ProductCardView {...node.data /* the snapshot */} />,
  },
})
```

End-to-end flow this exercises: register source → register node with a resource field → author picks via the standard ComboBox → `toData` projects the option into the node's snapshot → `renderResting` paints the snapshot → bake persists the snapshot so the reader is static → `resolve` refreshes on mount → if `products` is not registered in this deployment, the insert affordance is hidden (provenance). Nothing here is media-specific, which is the whole point.

### 2.7 Pull-forward checklist (cheap now, expensive to retrofit)

These are the corners usually deferred; do them on day one because the data shape and seams harden around them.

- **Optional capabilities from the start.** `load?` and `resolve?` are optional on the source type, so embed (resolve-only, paste-a-URL) and a browse-only picker are the same type with different fields filled — no special-casing embed later.
- **`toData` returns a patch, not a value.** A citation or product card projects several fields at once; `toData(option) → Partial<data>` makes multi-field projection native. A single-value return forces a rewrite the first time a block needs two fields.
- **The snapshot is the error fallback.** A dangling ref or a failed `resolve` renders the stale snapshot plus a quiet "couldn't refresh" affordance, never a blank. This is the docs/015 §10 baked-field-staleness risk applied to refs — solved once, in the engine, for every reference block.
- **Provenance gating wired immediately.** Source present → insert affordance enabled; absent → hidden (006 §7.9). A registry lookup, not a feature; deferring it ships custom blocks broken in deployments that lack their source.
- **Stale-while-revalidate, not store-only.** Render the snapshot instantly, then `resolve` on mount and patch. Store-only means a renamed post never updates; SWR is small and is the difference between a live reference and a dead copy.

### 2.8 Decision to settle before building

Whether the **host-node registry** (006 §5.3 — opaque `renderEditor`/`renderReadOnly` host blocks) is a separate escape hatch or just the degenerate reference block whose projection is "store the whole record" and whose render is host-supplied. Lean: the latter — one concept, not two parallel "host block" mechanisms. Settle it before building so a second mechanism does not grow.

### 2.9 Slices to pick up (lock the shape first, per the SPI-first rule)

- Public source registry: `registerDataSource` / `getDataSource` / `listDataSources` (`{ id, load?, resolve? }`).
- Resource config-field kind: `NodeViewConfigField` becomes a union — `{ kind: "text" }` (today) | `{ kind: "resource", source, toData }`. The editor renders the standard ComboBox for the resource kind.
- Resolved-ref access in render: a hook/arg so `renderResting` shows the snapshot now and refreshes from `resolve` (SWR).
- Snapshot persistence: confirm bake/serialize carries the snapshot so the reader is static (node data already serializes; make the contract explicit).
- Rebuild built-in media + post-ref on the SPI; restore `allowedEmbedDomains` as an embed source with `resolve`-only.
- Resolve the §2.8 host-node-registry decision and implement whichever shape wins.

## 3. Comments (half-migrated) — designed in docs/027

The data model and derived index are ported; the authoring workflow is not. `comment`/`glossary` are identity marks in the model (`core/model/marks.ts:119`), render as annotation spans (`view/render/mark-render.tsx:129`), and bake builds a `CommentIndexEntry` rollup (`core/bake/bake.ts:152-193`). Missing: a comment command, the popover UI, and the host callbacks `onComment` / `comments` / `onCommentUpdate` / `onCommentDelete` (legacy at `editor-legacy/src/nodes/base.tsx:56-69`). So a comment mark can be stored and shown but never authored or threaded. Glossary authoring is in the same state.

The full design is now docs/027 (Review tab, side-panel dock, document-insight surfaces) — pending design review, no backlog scoped yet. Settled there: Review is the document-insight surface (everything bake derives — comments, glossary, word count, a11y, broken refs — shown back as panes consuming the live document index). Comments are host-owned (a Comment Source SPI, sibling of docs/026: thread CRUD + resolve, mark stores `{thread, snapshot}`); glossary is document-owned (a generic Document Collections SPI document-level slot, glossary as first tenant, mark stores `{term}` referencing a single registry item — define-once/reference-everywhere, two flows define-first + type-first converge). A generic Side Panel SPI / tabbed dock (one pane visible, editor chrome not host layout — distinct from the removed aside rail) holds the panes. Add-actions live in the selection flyout + Review tab, NOT Home (overrides docs/006 §4.2). Posture: recommendation-only, never auto-modify the author's document.

## 4. The reader tier — `packages/reader`, retiring content-renderer (docs/015)

Not started. `packages/reader` does not exist; `content-renderer` (`@quanghuy1242/idco-content-renderer`) is still live and wired (tsconfig, pnpm-lock), still `"use client"` for one no-op checkbox (docs/015 §3.1). The substrate exists: the non-virtualized resting render (`virtualize={false}`) and `RestingDocument` (`view/render/resting-document.tsx`) are the editor half of the shared primitive layer (docs/015 §4.1 L2b). Sequence as docs/015 lays out:

- Create `packages/reader` at the bottom of the dependency graph; extract the RSC-safe `RichText*` / resting primitives into L1 (no `"use client"`, no hooks, no handlers), splitting the interactive bits (checklist checkbox, live code, scroll-spy TOC) into L3 islands.
- Write the server `<Reader>` over a projection adapter (consume `RichTextEditorDocument` today, `EditorDocumentSnapshot` after the persistence flip) so retiring Lexical later is just an adapter swap.
- Add the import-boundary lint that fails on any client import reaching L1 (mirror of the editor-core purity rule).
- Re-point content-renderer's consumers at `packages/reader`, then delete content-renderer.
- After editor↔reader parity and the persistence flip, remove `editor-legacy` (Lexical) — the editor is the only editor, the server reader the only reader (docs/015 §8).

**Status (2026-06-24): first-release scope (R0–R6) shipped in-repo; `pnpm check` green (1051 tests + all-package build).** `packages/reader` exists at the bottom of the graph: L1 RSC-safe primitives + the `.rt-*` typography contract (`src/l1`), the server `<Reader>` + projection adapter + content-visibility (`src/reader`), and the opt-in client islands behind the `./islands` entry (checklist/live-code/scroll-spy + `createIslandRenderer`). The editor's static object renders (media/embed/post-ref/table) now import the L1 primitives (component identity); the live editing surface wears the shared `.rt-*` classes for heading/quote and injects `RICH_TEXT_TYPOGRAPHY_CSS`, and the duplicated heading/quote rules were deleted from the live `ENGINE_TYPOGRAPHY_CSS`. The `reader-l1-purity` oxlint rule guards the boundary (no `"use client"`/hook/island/@idco/ui import reaches L1). `content-renderer` is deleted in-repo; its story + the two editor tests repoint to `<Reader>`, and `tests/reader.test.tsx` replaces the old test. Deliberately deferred (documented, not silent): (a) removing the now-superseded `RichText*` from `@idco/ui` — kept because Ladle stories still import them; their removal is the remaining in-repo reclaim once the stories repoint; (b) unifying the editor's RestingDocument-preview + inline-mark + callout/list-container chrome onto `.rt-*` (different live DOM / spacing model — the published reader is the clean L1 path); (c) the cross-repo repin (content-api → `@quanghuy1242/idco-reader`) + tagged release; (d) R7 (snapshot adapter + Lexical removal) and §12 (reader-side glossary/comments, downstream of docs/027), both future per §1.2/§15.

## 5. Drag-to-reorder blocks

Legacy has `draggable-block-plugin.tsx` (grab a block by a handle, drop it elsewhere). The owned editor has no draggable / drop-indicator / move-by-drag — it can `remove-block` but not reposition by drag (`view/render/object-block.tsx:92-94`). The one direct-manipulation affordance legacy had that the owned editor dropped. The model already supports moving nodes (the table column/row move composes `move-node`); this is the view-layer handle + drop-indicator + a move command, not new core.

## 6. `allowedNodes` — a per-deployment schema profile

Legacy takes an `allowedNodes` prop; the owned editor has none (it has `toolbarCapabilities` flags but no node-type allowlist). It is not one thing — it is two enforcement points over one set:

- **Palette gate (insert time):** which node types the author can add — hide "table" where the deployment disallows it. UX.
- **Schema gate (import/round-trip time):** which node types may exist in a stored document — drop or reject a disallowed node on load. Data integrity; the host already enforces this server-side with a Zod union (docs/006 §2.7), and the editor should honor the same contract.

The honest model is a **schema profile** ("blog profile" vs "book profile"), each a subset of the registry. The registry knows every node type that could exist; the profile is the allowlist of what this deployment permits, enforced at insert and at import. For reference blocks (item 2) the profile is partly implied — no `posts` source registered means post-ref can't function, so provenance already gates it (006 §7.9); the profile only makes deliberate calls about owned blocks (does the blog allow tables?) plus which collections are exposed.

**Status (2026-06-24): done.** Settled with the user: the allowlist is over schema **groups**, not raw types — a group is the unit of structural coherence, so `table`/`tablerow`/`tablecell` share group `"table"` and toggle as one (a profile can never describe the incoherent "table on, cell off" state); the prose floor (paragraph/heading/quote/list) is ungrouped and always permitted. The import gate is **quarantine, not deletion**: an out-of-profile node already in a loaded document is preserved untouched (the snapshot round-trips byte-for-byte) and renders an inert placeholder with a remove affordance (removable-but-never-auto-removed); the server's Zod union (006 §2.7) stays the hard authority that rejects on write. Shipped: `SchemaProfile` ({ allowedGroups }) on `EditorStoreOptions` — held opaquely on the store, core never reads the group strings; `schemaGroup` on `NodeView`/`StructuralNodeView` + groups on the built-ins; `isNodeTypeAllowed`/`schemaGroupOf` (`view/spi/schema-profile.ts`) resolving type→group; the palette gate next to the provenance gate in both resolvers (`command-surface.ts`, `toolbar-layout.ts`); and the quarantine render at the single block-dispatch chokepoint (`block-dispatch.tsx` → `quarantine-block.tsx`), placed before the structural recursion so a quarantined container never paints orphan children. Tests: `tests/editor/engine-schema-profile.test.ts`. Both gates read the profile from the store, so no view-prop threading; a consumer sets it via `new EditorStore({ schemaProfile })`.

## 7. Scheduler & bake — usage optimization (not a parity gap, an under-use of what's already built)

This item is different in kind from 1-6: nothing is missing versus legacy, but two systems the owned engine already owns — the engine scheduler (`core/scheduler.ts`) and the bake cluster (`core/bake/`) — are under-used in ways that leave performance and observability on the table. The trigger was a "should we merge bake and the scheduler?" question; the answer is no — they are orthogonal — but the investigation surfaced concrete optimizations.

### 7.1 Why they are orthogonal (do NOT merge)

The scheduler answers *when* and *how often* main-thread work runs: lanes (`sync`/`frame`/`idle`/`debounced`), a one-payload coalescing slot, priority, and a per-frame budget, all reported to the `__IDCO_EDITOR_PERF__` dashboard. Bake answers *what* pure compute runs and *on which thread*: pure DOM-free functions (`bakeObjectData`, `buildDocumentIndex`) plus a `postMessage` worker transport (`BakeService`) that moves heavy compute off the main thread entirely. Scheduler = timing/throttling on the main thread; bake = compute placement across threads. The code already states this deliberately: `bake-service.ts:8` calls the service "a compute service, not a second scheduler (§7.5): callers await it from the idle / debounced lanes; the main scheduler still owns the main-thread lanes." Merging them would conflate "budget the main thread" with "get off the main thread," which are different concerns. They are meant to *compose*: a scheduler idle/debounced task decides *when*, the bake service does the heavy *what* off-thread.

### 7.2 Current state — what actually uses each

The scheduler governs exactly one task: `engine-selection-overlay` in `store-hooks.ts:67` (the frame-lane selection repaint), with `use-drag-selection.ts:119` calling `flushLane("frame")` and `use-editor-diagnostics.ts:161` reading `snapshot()`. No object nodes use `createTask`. Meanwhile several places hand-roll their own timers, each invisible to the dashboard and each free to spend a full budget independently — the exact problem the shared lane budget was built to prevent (`scheduler.ts:236-245`): the document-index rebuild's `setTimeout` debounce (`use-document-index.ts:63-99`), autosave's `setTimeout` debounce (`use-autosave.ts:91`), the fling-exit timer (`use-virtual-window.ts:369`), touch-selection's timer (`use-touch-selection.ts:242`), and one-shot focus `requestAnimationFrame`s in `context-menu.tsx`, `ribbon.tsx`, `code-block.tsx`. On the bake side, `BakeService` exposes two capabilities but only `buildIndex` is wired (and it bypasses the scheduler); `bakeObject` (`bake-service.ts:76`) is built but unused. All real baking is synchronous main-thread: `commands/objects.ts:73` (insert object), `editor-store.ts:558` (`resolveObject`, which runs on *every* virtualization remount of a reference block as you scroll), and `resting-document.tsx:57` (render fallback).

### 7.3 Recommendations, prioritized by payoff vs risk

- **P1 — Route the document-index rebuild through the scheduler (low risk, high payoff).** Replace the raw `setTimeout` in `use-document-index.ts:63-99` with a `scheduler.createTask({ lane: "idle", coalesce: "latest", label: "engine-document-index" })` whose body awaits `bakeService.buildIndex(...)`. This is the cleanest win because it unifies both systems exactly as §7.5 intends: the O(N) `store.toSnapshot()` clone + worker round-trip coalesce under the idle lane (not a fixed debounce that fires mid-burst), the work appears in the perf dashboard next to the selection overlay, and the "second debouncer" disappears. Behavior stays "rebuild after commits settle, off-thread," just governed centrally.
- **P2 — Wire bake's unused off-thread path for heavy objects (medium).** `BakeService.bakeObject` exists but nothing calls it. Do NOT blindly move the synchronous bakes off-thread: sync bake at insert/edit time is arguably correct because the node must be publish-ready atomically inside the transaction, and an async bake introduces a "baking…" limbo state. The right rule is cost-tiered — cheap built-in bakers stay synchronous; heavy bakers (code highlighting, large tables, future custom objects) declare themselves async and run through `bakeService.bakeObject` from a scheduler idle task, landing the snapshot via the existing no-undo `resolveObject` path. The plumbing already exists; only the trigger and a per-baker cost flag are missing. **Deferred (grounded 2026-06-24):** no precondition is met yet. Every built-in baker is trivial — the `code-block` bake is just text + language + line-count (`object-registry.ts` `bake(data)`); syntax highlighting is render-time, not bake-time — so there is no heavy synchronous baker to relieve today. And the worker dispatcher bakes with a *built-ins-only* registry (`runBakeWorkerJob` → `createDefaultBlockRegistry()`), because custom bakers are functions that cannot cross `postMessage`; so "future custom objects" — P2's main motivation — cannot use this path at all without first giving the worker a custom-baker transport. Adding a public per-baker cost flag and a "baking…" UX state now would serve zero real bakers on a path that structurally can't reach the custom case. Pick this up when a genuinely heavy *built-in* baker lands (or the worker gains custom-baker transport), not before.
- **P3 — Kill the per-remount `JSON.stringify` in `resolveObject` (medium, pure main-thread win).** `editor-store.ts:561-564` runs up to four `JSON.stringify` calls (data, baked-from, baked-to) to no-op-detect, and the resolve controller calls it on every virtualization remount (`use-resolve.ts:91` is intentionally idempotent), so scrolling a doc full of reference blocks re-serializes JSON on the main thread repeatedly. Replace with a cheaper guard — a structural/`Object.is` shallow check, or a `revision` counter on the node — so the idempotent call is genuinely free.
- **P4 — Fold remaining coalescible timers into lanes (lower, consistency).** Autosave (`use-autosave.ts:91`) is a natural `debounced`-lane task and triggers an O(N) `getEditorSnapshot()`, so it gains both budget-sharing and dashboard visibility. The fling-exit and touch-selection timers are more state-machine than coalescible work and may legitimately stay raw — document *why* if they do. The one-shot focus `requestAnimationFrame`s are not burst work; leave them.

### 7.4 What not to do

Do not merge the two modules — the boundary (when/how-often on the main thread vs what compute, which thread) is correct and already documented. Do not move cheap synchronous bakes off-thread for its own sake; it adds latency and a limbo state for no benefit.

### 7.5 Suggested order within this item

P1 → P3 → P2 → P4. P1 and P3 are self-contained and immediately measurable; P2 needs the cost-tier design; P4 is cleanup.

### 7.6 Status (2026-06-24)

P1, P3, and P4 are **done**. P1: the document-index rebuild now runs through a `scheduler.createTask({ lane: "idle", coalesce: "latest", label: "engine-document-index" })` whose body takes the `store.toSnapshot()` clone and awaits `bakeService.buildIndex` — the hand-rolled `setTimeout` debounce (and its `INDEX_REBUILD_DEBOUNCE_MS` constant) are gone, and the rebuild is now visible in `__IDCO_EDITOR_PERF__` (`use-document-index.ts`, wired from `react-view.tsx`). P3: `resolveObject` (`core/store/editor-store.ts`) now short-circuits on `Object.is(current.data, data) && status` *before* baking, so the per-remount idempotent calls from the resolve controller skip the re-bake and the four `JSON.stringify`s entirely. P4: the autosave debounce, the fling-exit timer, and the touch long-press timer keep their raw timers, now each with an inline comment stating why they legitimately stay off the scheduler (a decoupled public hook; a sliding state-machine deadline; a single-shot gesture deadline). P2 is **deferred** with the grounding recorded in §7.3.

## Order suggestion

Item 2 (host data SPI) is the spine — it blocks real authoring parity and is the thing custom blocks consume; lock its shape before building any slice. Item 4 (reader) is the other spine — it blocks retiring content-renderer and Lexical. Item 1 (alignment) is the cheapest standalone win (the reader already paints it). Item 5 (drag-reorder) is view-layer-only on an existing model capability. Item 3 (comments) is mostly UI + binding wiring on an existing model, and should be decided against item 2's reference-block concept. Item 6 (schema profile) pairs naturally with item 2 and the registry. Item 7 (scheduler & bake usage) is orthogonal to the parity work — it is a performance/observability tidy-up of systems that already exist, pickable at any time; its P1 (route the index rebuild through a scheduler idle task) and P3 (drop the per-remount stringify) are the lowest-risk, immediately measurable wins.
